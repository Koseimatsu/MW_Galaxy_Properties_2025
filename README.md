The data used in Matsumoto et al. (2025) is summarized in this repository:

1. The Global_Galaxy_Properties directory contains data on the global properties of our Milky Way-like galaxy simulation. This simulation data is the same as that of [Matsumoto et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A..79M/abstract). 
3. The Matsumoto2025_Attenuation directory contains data on the global attenuation curves of the simulation at different times and inclination angles.
4. The Read_Data directory includes an example Python script for reading these data.

Additional data from Matsumoto et al. (2024, 2025) — such as spatially resolved maps, infrared spectra, and etc — are available.
Please feel free to contact me at: kosei.matsumoto@ugent.be. I would be happy to share them!
